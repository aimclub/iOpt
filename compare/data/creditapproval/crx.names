4.  Relevant Information:

    This file concerns credit card applications.  All attribute names
    and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect
    confidentiality of the data.
  
    This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of
    attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of
    values, and nominal with larger numbers of values.  There
    are also a few missing values.
